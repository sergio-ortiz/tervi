          "EPA has updated List N to include the types of surfaces products can
          be used on (e.g., hard or soft) and use sites (e.g., hospital,
          institutional or residential). Products that can be applied via
          fogging are now noted in the formulation column. This additional
          information will empower the public to choose products that are
          appropriate for their specific circumstances." <br />
